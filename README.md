LangChain Fundamentals – Beginner Project
This repository contains a hands-on beginner-level project using LangChain, designed to understand how to build and manage LLM (Large Language Model) workflows step-by-step. The project is structured as a Jupyter Notebook and is part of my 20 Days of AI Projects Challenge (Day 6).

📌 Project Overview
This project explores the key components of LangChain by walking through:

Prompt engineering using PromptTemplate

Creating sequential chains

Introducing LangChain agents

Adding memory to retain conversation history

The goal is to gain a foundational understanding of how LangChain handles LLM orchestration before moving on to more complex use cases.

🛠️ Features Implemented
1. LangChain Setup
Installed and imported necessary LangChain modules

Connected to OpenAI (or other LLM backend if configured)

2. Prompt Templates
Created reusable prompt templates to interact with LLMs

Customized input variables and structure for consistency

3. SimpleSequentialChain
Passed user input through a basic chain to get immediate results

Focused on deterministic task flows

4. SequentialChain
Designed a multi-step reasoning pipeline where output from one chain feeds the next

Example: Generate a company name → then create a slogan for it

5. Agents
Introduced LangChain's AgentExecutor

Gave the LLM access to tools like Python REPL or search tools

Enabled the agent to choose its own path based on the query

6. Memory
Implemented ConversationBufferMemory to preserve the state

Enabled more context-aware interactions with the model

🧠 What I Learned
How to use LangChain modules for real-world tasks

Difference between prompt templates, chains, and agents

How memory enhances conversational context

How to build scalable and modular pipelines with LLMs

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langchain-beginner-project.git
cd langchain-beginner-project
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
3. Install Requirements
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: You’ll need an API key from OpenAI (or your preferred LLM provider) to run the model.

📌 Requirements
Python 3.8+

langchain

openai

streamlit (if planning to extend)

jupyter

You can manually install them:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install langchain openai jupyter
📬 Future Enhancements
Integrate vector databases (like FAISS or ChromaDB)

Add a frontend interface using Streamlit or Gradio

Build custom tools and actions for agents

Load PDFs or APIs as knowledge sources
